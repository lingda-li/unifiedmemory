% GPU & unified memory background
Accelerators are widely used in today's computer systems to improve overall performance and energy efficiency.
GPU is currently the most popular accelerator.
It has its own memory to 

On the other hand, managing unified memory space is challenging 

Since version 4.0, OpenMP has included GPU offloading support, which makes it an attractive option for GPU programming.

In this paper, we focus on discrete GPUs.
